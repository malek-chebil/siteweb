## 🎯 **NEXT: Set Up Cryptocurrency Wallets**

You need wallets to pay for domain and hosting anonymously.

### **Step 1: Monero Wallet (for Domain Registration)** ⏱️ 15 minutes

**Why Monero?** 
- Maximum anonymity (completely private transactions)
- Njalla (domain registrar) accepts Monero

**Option A: Cake Wallet (Mobile - Easiest)** ⭐ Recommended

1. **Download Cake Wallet**:
   - iOS: App Store → Search "Cake Wallet"
   - Android: Google Play Store → Search "Cake Wallet"
   - **Or** F-Droid (more privacy-focused)

2. **Create New Wallet**:
   - Open app → "Create New Wallet"
   - Choose wallet name: `DomainWallet` (or any name)
   - Set strong password (save it!)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Write down the **25-word seed phrase** on paper
   - Store seed phrase safely (this is your backup!)
   - Verify seed phrase when prompted

3. **Get Monero**:
   - You need ~€15-30 worth of Monero (for domain registration)
   - Option 1: Buy from exchange (Kraken, Binance, etc.) then withdraw to Cake Wallet
   - Option 2: Use exchange with Monero support
   - **Send Monero** to your Cake Wallet address

### **Step 2: Bitcoin Wallet (for Hosting Payment)** ⏱️ 10 minutes

**Why Bitcoin?**

**Electrum Wallet (Desktop - Recommended)**

   - Choose "Create a new seed"
   - Choose "Segwit" (recommended - lower fees)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Write down the **12-word seed phrase** on paper
   - Store seed phrase safely
   - Verify seed phrase when prompted
   - Set strong wallet password

4. **Get Bitcoin**:
   - You need ~€10-20 worth of Bitcoin (for 1 month hosting)
   - Option 1: Buy from Binance/Kraken, then withdraw to Electrum
   - Option 2: Use any exchange with Bitcoin support
