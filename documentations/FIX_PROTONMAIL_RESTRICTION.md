# 🔧 Fix ProtonMail Account Restriction

## ⚠️ Problem

ProtonMail has restricted your account from registering on third-party services (like Njalla). This happens when ProtonMail detects unusual registration activity.

## ✅ **Solution Options**

### **Option 1: Add Recovery Email/Phone (Recommended)** ⭐

**This is the easiest way to lift the restriction.**

#### Step 1: Add Recovery Email

1. **Login to ProtonMail**: https://mail.proton.me
2. **Go to Settings**:
   - Click your profile icon (top right)
   - Click "Settings" or "All settings"
3. **Go to Security**:
   - Click "Security" in left menu
   - Scroll to "Recovery methods"
4. **Add Recovery Email**:
   - Click "Add recovery email"
   - Enter a **different email address** (can be Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - Click "Send verification email"
   - Check that email inbox
   - Click verification link
   - Return to ProtonMail
5. **Verify Recovery Email**:
   - Should show "Verified" next to recovery email
6. **Try Njalla again**:
   - The restriction should be lifted
   - Try registering on Njalla again

#### Step 2: Add Phone Number (Alternative)

If you prefer phone verification:

1. **Go to Settings → Security**
2. **Add Phone Number**:
   - Click "Add phone number"
   - Enter your phone number
   - Choose country code
   - Click "Send verification code"
   - Enter code received via SMS
3. **Verify Phone**:
   - Should show "Verified"
4. **Try Njalla again**

**⚠️ Privacy Note**: Adding phone number is less private, but recovery email is fine for anonymity.

### **Option 2: Upgrade to Paid Plan**

**If you want to avoid verification:**

1. **Go to ProtonMail**: https://mail.proton.me
2. **Go to Settings → Dashboard → Plans**
3. **Choose Plan**:
   - **Proton Mail Plus**: €3.99/month (cheapest paid option)
   - **Proton Unlimited**: €9.99/month (includes VPN, etc.)
4. **Pay**:
   - Can pay with cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, etc.)
   - More anonymous payment options
5. **Restriction lifted**:
   - Paid accounts typically don't have this restriction

**Cost**: €3.99-9.99/month

### **Option 3: Use Alternative Email Service**

**If you can't/won't verify ProtonMail:**

#### Option A: Tutanota (Privacy-focused)

1. **Go to**: https://tutanota.com
2. **Create account**:
   - Similar to ProtonMail
   - Privacy-focused
   - Free tier available
   - No phone required (usually)
3. **Use for Njalla registration**

#### Option B: Create Second ProtonMail Account

1. **Use different IP** (different VPN server or wait a bit)
2. **Create new ProtonMail account**:
   - Use different pseudonym
   - Use for Njalla only
   - May work if restriction is account-specific

#### Option C: Use Temporary Email (Less Private)

**⚠️ Not recommended for anonymity**, but works:

1. **Use temporary email service**:
   - https://temp-mail.org
   - https://10minutemail.com
   - Just for initial registration
2. **Then change email** in Njalla settings to ProtonMail later
