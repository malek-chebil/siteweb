## ✅ **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Use VPN Only (Easier)** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

**For your hosting setup:**
- ✅ **VPN (Mullvad) alone is enough** for 1984 Hosting
- ✅ VPN provides good privacy
- ✅ Less complicated than Tor
- ✅ Faster connection

**Action**:
1. **Make sure Mullvad VPN is connected** ✅
2. **Use regular browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
3. **Access 1984 Hosting**: https://www.1984.hosting
4. **Continue with hosting setup**

**Privacy level**: Good ✅ (VPN alone is sufficient for hosting/VPS setup)

### **Option 2: Restart Tor Browser**

**If you want to fix Tor:**

1. **Close Tor Browser completely**:
   - Close all windows
   - Check Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) - kill all Tor processes

2. **Restart Tor Browser**:
   - Launch again
   - Wait for connection (can take 1-2 minutes)

3. **If still not working**:
   - Restart your computer
   - Try again

### **Option 3: Reinstall Tor Browser**

**If Tor keeps not responding:**

1. **Download fresh Tor Browser**:
   - Go to: https://www.torproject.org/download/
   - Download latest version
   - Install fresh copy

2. **Configure**:
   - First launch might ask to configure
   - Choose "Connect" (direct connection)
   - Or "Configure" if behind firewall

### **Option 4: Use Tor Browser Alternative**

**If Tor is blocked or not working:**

**Use Tails OS** (if you have it):
- Boot from USB
- Tor is built-in
- Maximum anonymity

**Or use Whonix** (virtual machine):
- Tor routing built-in
- More complex setup

**But for your use case**: VPN alone is fine!
